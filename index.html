<p>
    Welcome to my website!
</p>

<p>
    My name is <b>Temi Olorunsogo</b>. I am an HCI researcher focused on community-based efforts with nonprofits 
    to explore how AI/technology can be used for social impact through participatory methods.

    <br><br>
    My main research interests lie in <b>leveraging inclusive and responsible technologies to drive meaningful social impact</b>, 
    particularly how technology can be a force for good, uplifting communities, and transforming lives. 
    Iâ€™m currently interviewing tech support professionals to uncover challenges in these collaborations and identify strategies 
    to maintain effective long-term partnerships.    

     <br/>

    I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder,
    working in the <a href="https://amy.voida.com/research-group/" target="_blank">Philanthropic Informatics Lab</a> with
    <a href="https://amy.voida.com/">Professor Amy Voida</a>.
